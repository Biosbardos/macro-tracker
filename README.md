# macro-tracker
Simple Macro Tracker made to facilitate the labor of counting calories, without ads (obviously) and with unlimited amount of custom meals. 

In order to star this program you only need to go to bin/Debug and click in the main.exe to start the macro tracker. 

Also, datos.txt and objetos.txt are examples of the 2 files the program creates after you give your data and start making custom meals, if you want you can use the already existing meals moving objetos.txt to the same folder as main.exe
