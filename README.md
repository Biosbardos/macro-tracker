# macro-tracker Documentation

Thanks to Doxygen and to Github Pages, this repository now has online documentation: [macro-tracker Documentation](https://biosbardos.github.io/macro-tracker/).

IMPORTANT REMINDER: Due to the considerable effort required to update the Doxygen-generated documentation with every commit on the main branch, this branch will only commit documentation updates with the release of new stable versions.
